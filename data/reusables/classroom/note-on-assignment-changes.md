{% note %}

**Note:** In January 2024, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} changed the way student repositories are created from starter code repositories. Previously, the process required starter code repositories to be templates, and {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} created a new repository for each student based on that template. With the change, student repositories are now created by forking the starter code repository.

This change addresses a frequently requested feature from teachers: the ability to change starter code after an assignment has been accepted by students.

You can read more about this change on the [{% data variables.product.company_short %} blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-22-migrating-github-classroom-assignment-repository-creation-from-create-from-template-to-forks-public-beta/).

This feature is in public beta and subject to change.
