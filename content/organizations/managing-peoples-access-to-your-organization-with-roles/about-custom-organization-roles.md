## About custom organization roles

{% data reusables.organizations.custom-org-roles-intro %}

You can create and assign custom organization roles in your organization's settings. You can also manage custom roles using the REST API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-organization-roles)."

Organization permissions do not grant read, write, or administrator access to any repositories. Some permissions may implicitly grant visibility of repository metadata, as marked in the table below.

To granularly control access to your organization's repositories, you can create a custom repository role. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/about-custom-repository-roles)."

## Permissions for custom roles

When you include a permission in a custom organization role, any users with that role will have access to the corresponding settings via both the web browser and API. In the organization's settings in the browser, users will see only the pages for settings they can access.
