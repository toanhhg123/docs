{% ifversion push-protection-delegated-bypass %}

By default, anyone with write access to the repository can choose to bypass push protection by specifying one of the bypass reasons outlined in the table. If you want greater control over which contributors can bypass push protection and which pushes containing secrets should be allowed, you can enable delegated bypass for push protection. Delegated bypass lets you configure a designated group of reviewers to oversee and manage requests to bypass push protection from contributors pushing to the repository. For more information, see "[Enabling delegated bypass for push protection](#enabling-delegated-bypass-for-push-protection)."

{% endif %}

{% ifversion secret-scanning-bypass-filter %}

On the {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} alerts page for a repository or organization, you can apply the `bypassed:true` filter to easily see which alerts are the result of a user bypassing push protection. For more information on viewing these alerts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning)."

{% endif %}

You can monitor security alerts to discover when users are bypassing push protections and creating alerts. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/auditing-security-alerts)."

{% ifversion security-overview-push-protection-metrics-page %}

If you are an organization owner or security manager, you can view metrics on how push protection is performing across your organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/viewing-metrics-for-secret-scanning-push-protection)."

Organization owners, security managers, and repository administrators can also enable push protection for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} via the API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/repos#update-a-repository)" and expand the "Properties of the `security_and_analysis` object" section.

Organization owners can provide a custom link that will be displayed when a push is blocked. This custom link can contain organization-specific resources and advice, such as directions on using a recommended secrets vault or who to contact for questions relating to the blocked secret.

{% ifversion secret-scanning-enable-by-default-for-public-repos %}

You can also enable push protection for all of your existing {% ifversion ghec %}user-owned {% endif %} public repositories through your personal account settings. For any new public repositories you create, push protection will be enabled by default. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-repositories#enabling-secret-scanning-alerts-for-users-for-all-your-public-repositories)."

{% ifversion push-protection-delegated-bypass %}

## Enabling delegated bypass for push protection

{% data reusables.secret-scanning.push-protection-delegate-bypass-beta-note %}

Delegated bypass for push protection lets you control who can bypass push protection and which blocked pushes should be allowed.

When you enable push protection, by default, anyone with write access to the repository can choose to bypass the protection by specifying a reason for allowing the push containing a secret. With delegated bypass, contributors to a repository are instead obligated to request "bypass privileges." The request is sent to a designated group of reviewers, who either approve or deny the request to bypass push protection.

If the request to bypass push protection is approved, the contributor can push the commit containing the secret. If the request is denied, the contributor must remove the secret from the commit (or commits) containing the secret before pushing again.

To configure delegated bypass, organization owners or repository administrators first create a "bypass list". The bypass list comprises specific roles and teams, such as the security team or repository administrators, who oversee requests from non-members to bypass push protection. For more information, see "[Configuring delegated bypass for an organization](#configuring-delegated-bypass-for-an-organization)" and "[Configuring delegated bypass for a repository](#configuring-delegated-bypass-for-a-repository)."

Members of the bypass list view and manage requests through the "Push protection bypass" page in the **Security** tab of the repository. For more information, see "[Managing requests to bypass push protection](#managing-requests-to-bypass-push-protection)."

Members of the bypass list are still protected from accidentally pushing secrets to a repository. When a member of the bypass list attempts to push a commit containing a secret, their push is still blocked, but they can choose to bypass the block by specifying a reason for allowing the push. Members of the bypass list do not have to request bypass privileges from other members in order to override the block.

### Configuring delegated bypass for an organization

{% data reusables.organizations.navigate-to-org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.security-and-analysis %}
{% ifversion security-configurations %}
    {% data reusables.security-configurations.changed-org-settings-global-settings-callout %}
{% endif %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-ghas-settings %}
1. Under "Push protection", to the right of "Who can bypass push protection for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}", select the dropdown menu, then click **Specific roles or teams**.
1. Under "Bypass list", click **Add role or team**.
   >[!NOTE] You can't add secret teams to the bypass list.
1. In the dialog box, select the roles and teams that you want to add to the bypass list, then click **Add selected**.

### Configuring delegated bypass for a repository

>[!NOTE] If an organization owner configures delegated bypass at the organization-level, the repository-level settings are disabled.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-code-security-and-analysis %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-ghas-settings %}
1. Under "Push protection", to the right of "Who can bypass push protection for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}", select the dropdown menu, then click **Specific roles or teams**.
1. Under "Bypass list", click **Add role or team**.
   >[!NOTE] You can't add secret teams to the bypass list.
1. In the dialog box, select the roles and teams that you want to add to the bypass list, then click **Add selected**.

## Managing requests to bypass push protection

You can view and manage all requests for bypass privileges on the "Push protection bypass" page, located under the **Security** tab of the repository.

You can filter requests by approver (member of the bypass list), requester (contributor making the request), timeframe, and status. The following statuses are assigned to a request:

|Status|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`Cancelled`| The request has been cancelled by the contributor.|
|`Completed`|The request has been approved and the commit(s) have been pushed to the repository.|
|`Denied`|The request has been reviewed and denied.|
|`Expired`| The request has expired. Requests are valid for 7 days. |
|`Open`| The request has either not yet been reviewed, or has been approved but the commit(s) have not been pushed to the repository.  |

When a contributor requests bypass privileges to push a commit containing a secret, members of the bypass list all receive an email notification containing a link to the request. Members of the bypass list then have 7 days to review and either approve or deny the request before the request expires.

The contributor is notified of the decision by email and must take the required action. If the request is approved, the contributor can push the commit containing the secret to the repository. If the request is denied, the contributor must remove the secret from the commit in order to successfully push the commit to the repository.

### Managing requests to bypass push protection at the repository-level

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-security %}
{% data reusables.repositories.bypass-requests-settings %}
1. Select the **All statuses** dropdown menu, then click **Open** to view requests that are awaiting review.
1. Click the request that you want to review.
1. Review the details of the request.
1. To allow the contributor to push the commit containing the secret, click **Approve bypass request**. Or, to require the contributor to remove the secret from the commit, click **Deny bypass request**.
