## About security risks in your code

You can use security overview to see which repositories and teams are free from any security alerts and which have unresolved security alerts. The "Security risk" page shows a summary and detailed information on which repositories in an organization {% ifversion security-overview-org-risk-coverage-enterprise %}or enterprise {% endif %}are affected by security alerts, with a breakdown of alert by severity. You can filter the view to show a subset of repositories using the "affected" and "unaffected" links, the links under "Open alerts", the "Teams" dropdown menu, and a search field in the page header. This view is a great way to understand the broader picture for a repository, team, or group of repositories because you can see security alerts of all types in one view.

{% ifversion security-overview-export-data %}
You can download a CSV file of the data displayed on the "Security risk" page. This data file can be used for efforts like security research and in-depth data analysis, and can integrate easily with external datasets. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/exporting-data-from-the-risk-and-coverage-pages)."
{% endif %}

{% note %}

**Note:** It's important to understand that all repositories without open alerts are included in the set of unaffected repositories. That is, unaffected repositories include any repositories where the feature is not enabled, in addition to repositories that have been scanned and any alerts identified have been closed.
